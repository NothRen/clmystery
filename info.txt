# Crimescene
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

# Interwiev
Joe germuska : Should not be considered a suspect, has no SkyMiles membership and has never been a member of the Museum of Bash History.
----
Jeremy bowers : 
Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.

After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.

Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.
----
Erika owens :Owens has an alibi for the morning in question, she was in Toronto for the Mozilla All Hands Meeting.  Multiple sources, including a person in a fox costume, corroborate this.  Not a suspect.
----
Aron pilhofer:Too short to match the camera footage.  Pilhofer is not considered a suspect.
----
heather billing : Billings should not be considered a suspect, she is too short to match the camera footage and the killer is believed to be male.
----
jacqui maher : Maher is not considered a suspect.  Video evidence confirms that she was away at a professional soccer game on the morning in question, even though it was a workday.
